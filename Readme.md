# Objective
Mantain a simple mips pipeline processor written in different vhdl.
## Processor type
This processor is made to simulate a pipelined mips processor 
structures.
## Software used
Altera Quartus 13 sp 1 and model sim 13 sp 1.
## Observations
This software is not working well, simulations are not working,and it is 
unstable,can be used for learning the basis of the processor
## What is not implemented.
All instructins for floating point units, 
working only with integers,Forwarding unit and Hazards 
detection ,nops will be required 
to make it work.
