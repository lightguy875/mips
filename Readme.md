##Objective
Mantain a simple mips pipeline processor written in different vhdl.
#Processor type
This processor is made to simulate a pipelined mips processor 
structures.
#Software used
Altera Quartus 13 sp 1 and model sim 13 sp 1.
#Observations
This software is not working well, simulations are not working,and it is 
unstable,can be used for learning the basis of the processor
#What is not implemented.
Most instructions are not implemented for this hardware,all 
instructins for floating point units are not implemented,not 
working with those numbers only integers,Forwarding unit and Hazards 
detection not implemented for this processor,nops will be required 
to make it work.
